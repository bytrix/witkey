Campus Witkey
-------------

This is my little web project made with Laravel 4.2 which aims to encourage students who has special talent to help someone in need.

**About myself**

> Software Engineering Student in school, crazy about technolygy and art
> but not proficient. A short time ago, a little conflict happened in
> school between someone and me so that I have to  quit school.
> Fortunately, it's a chance for me because I can spend all my spare
> time in programming learning. To summarize the self-study plan,
> acturally I did learn something new that I don't know before like
> linux, git and web framework.Previously, I do almost work in windows
> and now I change to linux environment so that I could learn more about
> programming with so much open source code.

**Let's keep on track**
change directory to Framework and type the command line:
